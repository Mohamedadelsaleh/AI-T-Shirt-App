## Live Demo

[AI-T-Shirt Live Link](https://ai-t-shirt-app.vercel.app/)

## Description
In this app, I used many npm packages and all tools and packages are:
- ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
  + React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
  + TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
  + Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations
    You'll also learn how to: Load, create, and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and the positioning of an object in space.
  + Make your code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
  + Add custom color and file support.
  + Generate and use images through DALLE AI
  + Download the resulting t-shirt model image
  + Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve your site's performance
